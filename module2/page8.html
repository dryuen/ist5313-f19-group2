  This text will include information and steps on what to do when the dog pulls 
<p>Leash issues are a huge problem for the dog-owning public and a leading culprit for why so many otherwise healthy dogs are doomed to
life (or usually more accurately, an early death) in animal shelters. Whether it's simple leash-pulling or more significant leash reactivity and
leash aggression, the primary thing to keep in mind is that these issues are almost always preventable and manageable when using positive 
	training methods.</p>
				<p>How To Stop Your Dog From Pulling On Leash:</p>
 <p> If you are overpowered by your dog’s pulling and cannot start the teaching process for fear of being pulled over, then there are 
humane equipment solutions to help modify the pulling while you teach your dog to walk appropriately.</p>
<p>A chest-led harness is a perfect training aid, as it takes pressure off a dog’s sensitive neck by distributing the pressure more evenly
around the body. When the leash is attached to a ring located on the chest strap and your dog pulls, the harness will turn his body around 
rather than allowing him to go forward. I recommend this kind of harness for anyone who needs extra help, as safety has to come first.</p>
 <p>Leash pulling is often successful for the dog because the person inadvertently reinforces the pulling by allowing their dog to get to 
where he wants to go when he pulls. But you can change this picture by changing the consequence for your dog.</p>
 <p>When he pulls, immediately stop and stand completely still until the leash relaxes, either by your dog taking a step back or turning 
around to give you focus. When the leash is nicely relaxed, proceed on your walk. Repeat this as necessary.</p>
 <p>If you find this technique too slow you can try the reverse direction method. When your dog pulls, issue a 'Let’s Go' cue, turn away
	 from him and walk off in the other direction, without jerking on the leash.</p>
