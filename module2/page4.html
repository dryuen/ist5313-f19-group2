				<b>Controlling Dog Behavior Problems</b>

<p>The first step in controlling poor behavior is determining the cause of the dog's reaction. Different medical conditions could lead to poor behavior,
such as a dog with an ear infection being more sensitive to noises and barking in protest, or a dog with a bladder infection urinating more 
around the house. Stress, anxiety or unfamiliar stimuli could also trigger bad behavior. Once the source of the poor behavior is discovered,
	it is possible to control the dog's response with different techniques, such as:</p>

    <p>Prevention:
    If you know the trigger for your dog's bad behavior, it may be easy to remove that trigger. For example, replace a doorbell when the 
    sound triggers barking, do not give your dog table scraps to prevent begging or keep your dog out of the kitchen if counter-surfing is a problem.
				</p>
    <p>Know Your Dog:
    In some cases, bad behavior may be because you aren't aware of your dog's needs. A puppy or senior dog that may pee in the house could be
    nefit from more frequent bathroom breaks outside. Recognizing your dog's signals can help you learn what it needs so you can help it 
    avoid behaving badly.</P

   <p> Exercise:
    Some bad behavior, such as digging or chasing, can be the result of pent-up energy. Giving your dog more exercise can help burn off 
    energy so your dog isn't tempted to behave poorly, and will reinforce your bond with your pet so it will be more likely to pay attention
	   to you and obey your commands.</p>

    <p>Ignore the Behavior:
    Many types of bad behavior are intended to get attention, such as jumping up, barking or begging. If you ignore the behavior, the dog 
   will not get the attention it is seeking, and its behavior will eventually change. This includes not shouting or punishing the dog's 
	    actions, because even bad attention is still attention the dog wants.</p>

    Redirection:
    Some behavior that may seem bad is actually instinctive for a dog, such as chewing and digging, and it may be impossible to completely stop the behavior. Instead, redirect the dog to more appropriate choices, such as providing safe chew toys or permitting digging in one specific spot to spare the rest of your possessions and yard from unwanted attention.
