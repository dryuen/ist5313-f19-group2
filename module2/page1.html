  After learning these simple tricks to complete with your dog inside the home, it will become necessary to take your dog outside for walks, socialization, and bathroom breaks. It is important to
  teach your dog how to behave on a leash early, because they will see how you perform on the leash with them as training. How you behave with them is what they will expect on future walks.
  <br> This section will provide an introduction to leash training. 
<p> The prep is important because it likely will be a disaster if you clip the leash on your puppy and walk out the door and expect him to 
	accept the leash, being outside in a new environment, AND walking next to you. That's way too many things for his developing brain to process. He may be frightened to go outside, and now you've compounded it by adding this thing that won't let him go where he wants. 
	He now has a bad association with the leash, and the associations that he makes in puppyhood can last a lifetime.</p>
<p> It's much easier to teach a puppy to walk next to you than to teach an older dog because you are teaching on a clean slate rather than erasing and teaching a new way. My advice - begin the process immediately! 
	And the process begins with teaching your dog to sit because many dogs squirm or run away and have you chase them when you are trying to put on the leash. 
	Avoid this by training him the right way from the beginning.</p>
